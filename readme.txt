Question 1. Which web event did you hook into to update the display name? 
    To update the display name, I used the "input" event listener. This means that as the user is inputting text into the box, the name will simultaneously change to match their input.
Question 2. Where in your HTML did you link to your JavaScript file? Are there better places? What's the best place?
    I linked my JavaScript file at the last line before I closed the body tag. The files are "compiled" top-to-bottom then left-to-right so had I linked it before my HTML document has fully loaded, my JS may try to access HTML elements that the computer hasn't yet seen. Given what I've been taught, the best place to link the JS file is just above the closing body tag.
Question 3. Why is it best practice to store your CSS/JS in external files rather than in your HTML file?
    This assignment was completed using only eight lines of JavaScript, so one could argue that it could be included directly in the HTML file. For larger projects, however, I assume that we will use far more lines of JS so it would clutter our HTML file if we included it there. Our projects should also have structure. This means that my HTML file should focus on HTML while my JS file should focus on JavaScript.
